	abstract = {{FSL} (the {FMRIB} Software Library) is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for functional, structural and diffusion {MRI} brain imaging data, written mainly by members of the Analysis Group, {FMRIB}, Oxford. For this {NeuroImage} special issue on “20 years of {fMRI”} we have been asked to write about the history, developments and current status of {FSL.} We also include some descriptions of parts of {FSL} that are not well covered in the existing literature. We hope that some of this content might be of interest to users of {FSL}, and also maybe to new research groups considering creating, releasing and supporting new software packages for brain image analysis.},
