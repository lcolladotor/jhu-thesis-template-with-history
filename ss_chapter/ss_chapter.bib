Safety stopping rules based on neurologic deterioration and serious adverse events were prespecified and approved by an {NIH}-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which provided oversight on subject safety. Each subject was followed-up for 3 months to preliminarily assess mortality and the clinical outcomes. A total of 18, 20, and 22 patients were enrolled in the respective three tiers of systolic blood pressure treatment goals. Overall, 9 of 60 patients had treatment failures (all in the last tier). A total of seven subjects with neurologic deterioration were observed: one (6\%), two (10\%), and four (18\%) in tier one, two, and three, respectively. Serious adverse events were observed in one subject (5\%) in tier two and in three subjects (14\%) in tier three. However, the safety stopping rule was not activated in any of the tiers. Three (17\%), two (10\%), and five (23\%) subjects in tiers one, two, and three, respectively, died within 3 months., Conclusions: The observed proportions of neurologic deterioration and serious adverse events were below the prespecified safety thresholds, and the 3-month mortality rate was lower than expected in all systolic blood pressure tiers. The results form the basis of a larger randomized trial addressing the efficacy of systolic blood pressure reduction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage., (C) 2010 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose— Although data on some risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) already are beyond doubt, for other factors, the evidence is less clear. We performed a systematic overview of case-control and cohort studies on risk factors for {ICH}.
Methods— We searched {MEDLINE}, {LILACS}, {EXTRAMED}, and Pascal from 1966 to 2001 to identify studies. Studies were included if they met predefined methodological criteria. When possible, 2×2 tables were extracted and combined with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Summary odds ratios ({ORs}) were calculated for case-control studies, and summary relative risks ({RRs}) were found for cohort studies and for case-control and cohort studies combined.
Results— Fourteen case-control and 11 cohort studies were identified. We could not always combine the results of case-control and cohort studies. In cohort studies, the crude {RR} for age (every 10-year increase) was 1.97 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.79 to 2.16). In case-control studies, the crude {OR} for high alcohol intake was 3.36 (95\% {CI}, 2.21 to 5.12) and for hypertension was 3.68 (95\% {CI}, 2.52 to 5.38). Two cohort studies showed an increasing risk of {ICH} with increasing degree of hypertension. In cohort and case-control studies combined, the crude {RR} for sex (male versus female) was 3.73 (95\% {CI}, 3.28 to 4.25); for current smoking, 1.31 (95\% {CI}, 1.09 to 1.58); and for diabetes, 1.30 (95\% {CI}, 1.02 to 1.67).
Conclusions— Risk factors for {ICH} appeared to be age, male sex, hypertension, and high alcohol intake. High cholesterol tends to be associated with a lower risk of {ICH}. We could not assess whether these risk factors are independent.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the 30-day mortality and morbidity of intracerebral hemorrhage in a large metropolitan population and to determine the most important predictors of 30-day outcome.
We reviewed the medical records and computed tomographic films for all cases of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in Greater Cincinnati during 1988. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were determined using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.
The 30-day mortality for the 188 cases of intracerebral hemorrhage was 44\%, with half of deaths occurring within the first 2 days of onset. Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage was the strongest predictor of 30-day mortality for all locations of intracerebral hemorrhage. Using three categories of parenchymal hemorrhage volume (0 to 29 cm3, 30 to 60 cm3, and 61 cm3 or more), calculated by a quick and easy-to-use ellipsoid method, and two categories of the Glasgow Coma Scale (9 or more and 8 or less), 30-day mortality was predicted correctly with a sensitivity of 96\% and a specificity of 98\%. Patients with a parenchymal hemorrhage volume of 60 cm3 or more on their initial computed tomogram and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less had a predicted 30-day mortality of 91\%. Patients with a volume of less than 30 cm3 and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9 or more had a predicted 30-day mortality of 19\%. Only one of the 71 patients with a volume of parenchymal hemorrhage of 30 cm3 or more could function independently at 30 days.
Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, in combination with the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, is a powerful and easy-to-use predictor of 30-day mortality and morbidity in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.},

Test-retest reliability did not differ significantly among a neurologist, a neurology house officer, a neurology nurse, or an emergency department nurse. The stroke scale validity was assessed by comparing the scale scores obtained prospectively on 65 acute stroke patients to the patients' infarction size as measured by computed tomography scan at 1 week and to the patients' clinical outcome as determined at 3 months. These correlations (scale-lesion size r = 0.68, scale-outcome r = 0.79) suggested acceptable examination and scale validity. Of the 15 test items, the most interrater reliable item (pupillary response) had low validity. Less reliable items such as upper or lower extremity motor function were more valid.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose: Trends in stroke incidence and mortality are available from few sites worldwide. The unique nature of the medical care in patients from Rochester, Minn, has allowed the ascertainment of virtually all cases of stroke for community residents for the period dating from 1955. This study updates incidence rates, stroke mortality, radiological imaging availability, and prevalence for stroke and subtypes of stroke though 1989 and evaluates trends since 1955., Methods: Medical records of all residents of Rochester with potential diagnosis of stroke during the 5-year period through December 31, 1989, were screened to determine whether the case met the criteria for stroke. The type of stroke was determined with the use of all available data. Average annual age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates for stroke and various types of stroke were calculated for 5-year periods from 1955 to 1989. Prevalence of stroke was also determined. Poisson regression was used to better clarify the dependence of stroke incidence on multiple variables. Cox proportional hazards modeling evaluated trends in short-term and long-term stroke survival., Results: We found that 496 incidence cases of stroke occurred among Rochester residents during 1985 to 1989. The annual age- and sex-adjusted stroke incidence rate was 145 per 100 000 population, which was virtually unchanged from 1980 to 1984 and 13\% higher than the rate determined in 1975 to 1979. Increasing incidence rates compared with the 1970s were noted in all groups aged older than 54 years and in both sexes. Survival after cerebral infarction was dependent on age and calendar year when trends dating from 1955 were evaluated. The annual incidence rate of intraparenchymal hemorrhage was twice that of subarachnoid hemorrhage., Conclusions: Incidence rates for stroke have remained at a higher rate than those determined in the 1970s. Although the occurrence of untreated hypertension has been reported to be stable or decreasing, the incidence rate of stroke is higher than those noted during the decline in stroke incidence during the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to the impact of radiological imaging, increased contribution of patients with ischemic heart disease, and the possible detection of milder cases of stroke, other factors, which are undefined, may be contributing to the increased stroke incidence rates detected over the last 10 years., (Stroke. 1996;27:373-380.), (C) 1996 American Heart Association, Inc.},

In this paper, we present an automated method to detect and classify an abnormality into acute infarct, chronic infarct and hemorrhage at the slice level of non-contrast {CT} images. The proposed method consists of three main steps: image enhancement, detection of mid-line symmetry and classification of abnormal slices. A windowing operation is performed on the intensity distribution to enhance the region of interest. Domain knowledge about the anatomical structure of the skull and the brain is used to detect abnormalities in a rotation- and translation-invariant manner. A two-level classification scheme is used to detect abnormalities using features derived in the intensity and the wavelet domain. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset of 15 patients (347 image slices). The method gives 90\% accuracy and 100\% recall in detecting abnormality at patient level; and achieves an average precision of 91\% and recall of 90\% at the slice level.},

  abstract = {Mutual information ({MI})-based image registration has been found to be quite effective in many medical imaging applications. To determine the {MI} between two images, the joint histogram of the two images is required. In the literature, linear interpolation and partial volume interpolation ({PVI}) are often used while estimating the joint histogram for registration purposes. It has been shown that joint histogram estimation through these two interpolation methods may introduce artifacts in the {MI} registration function that hamper the optimization process and influence the registration accuracy. In this paper, we present a new joint histogram estimation scheme called generalized partial volume estimation ({GPVE}). It turns out that the {PVI} method is a special case of the {GPVE} procedure. We have implemented our algorithm on the clinically obtained brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance image data furnished by Vanderbilt University. Our experimental results show that, by properly choosing the kernel functions, the {GPVE} algorithm significantly reduces the interpolation-induced artifacts and, in cases that the artifacts clearly affect registration accuracy, the registration accuracy is improved.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose— A simple clinical scale of intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}), comprising the Glasgow Coma Scale score, age, infratentorial origin, {ICH} volume, and intraventricular hemorrhage, was recently shown to predict 30-day mortality. We studied how well the original {ICH} Score would predict morbidity and mortality and determined whether modification would improve the predictions.
Methods— Patients admitted to a regional hospital with acute {ICH} in 1999 were reviewed. Independent predictors of mortality or good outcome (modified Rankin score ≤2) at 30 days were identified by logistic regression to devise a new {ICH} Score for comparison with the original Score. A modified Score was created by substituting National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) for the Glasgow Coma Scale.
Results— The mortality rate was 22\%, and 35\% had good outcome. Independent factors for mortality were high {NIHSS} score, intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid extension, and narrow pulse pressure. Independent factors for good outcome were low {NIHSS} score and low admission temperature. For all {ICH} Scores, no patient had a maximum score of 6. Cutoff values of ≥3 and {\textless}3 provided the best Youden’s index of diagnostic test in all {ICH} Scores for mortality and good outcome, respectively. The original and modified {ICH} Scores predict mortality equally well. The new and modified {ICH} Scores are slightly better for prediction of good outcome.
Conclusions— All 3 {ICH} Scores are simple clinical grading scales. As reliable predictors of good outcome and/or mortality, they are useful in clinical research studies and standardization of clinical protocols.},

This approach produces a consistent set of transformations that have less pairwise registration error, i.e., better correspondence, than traditional methods that estimate the forward and reverse transformations independently. The transformations are estimated iteratively and are restricted to preserve topology by constraining them to obey the laws of continuum mechanics. The transformations are parameterized by a Fourier series to diagonalize the covariance structure imposed by the continuum mechanics constraints and to provide a computationally efficient numerical implementation. Results using a linear elastic material constraint are presented using both magnetic resonance and X-ray computed tomography image data. The results show that the joint estimation of a consistent set of forward and reverse transformations constrained by linear-elasticity give better registration results than using either constraint alone or none at all.},

Design Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify independent risk factors and to construct a grading scale for predicting the outcome of {ICH}.
Setting The Taichung Veterans General Hospital in Taichung, Taiwan.
Participants Two hundred and ninety-three patients were diagnosed with spontaneous {ICH} between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2007.
Intervention Development of the simplified {ICH} score ({sICH} score) for predicting the 30-day mortality of {ICH}.
Main Outcome Measures The discrimination of the prediction model was determined by measuring the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ({AUC}).
Results The accuracy of the {sICH} score was 80.5\%, the sensitivity was 82.5\% and the specificity was 80.2\%. The {AUCs} are as follows: {sICH} score, 0.89 (0.84–0.94); {ICH} score, 0.74 (0.65–0.83) and {ICH}-{GS}, 0.74 (0.65–0.83).
Conclusions The {sICH} score showed best discrimination among tested models. Also, it was easier for physicians without special training in neurology or radiology to use this scale. With statistical power and ease of use, the {sICH} score is a very suitable model for risk stratification of spontaneous {ICH}.},

  abstract = {Explicit segmentation is required for many forms of quantitative neuroanatomic analysis. However, manual methods are time-consuming and subject to errors in both accuracy and reproducibility (precision). A 3-D model-based segmentation method is presented in this paper for the completely automatic identification and delineation of gross anatomical structures of the human brain based on their appearance in magnetic resonance images ({MRI}). The approach depends on a general, iterative, hierarchical non-linear registration procedure and a 3-D digital model of human brain anatomy that contains both volumetric intensity-based data and a geometric atlas. Here, the traditional segmentation strategy is inverted: instead of matching geometric contours from and idealized atlas directly to the {MRI} data, segmentation is achieved by identifying the non-linear spatial transformation that best maps corresponding intensity-based features between a model image and a new {MRI} brain volume. When completed, atlas contours defined on the model image are mapped through the same transformation to segment and label individual structures in the new data set. Using manually segmented sturcture boundaries for comparison, measures of volumetric difference and volumetric overlap were less than 2\% and better than 97\% for realistic brain phantom data, and less than 10\% and better than 85\%, respectively, for human {MRI} data. This compares favorably to intra-observer variability estimates of 4.9\% and 87\%, respectively. The procedure performs well, is objective and its implementation robust. The procedure requires no manual intervention, and is thus applicable to studies of large numbers of subjects. The general method for non-linear image matching is also useful for non-linear mapping of brain data sets into stereotaxic space if the target volume is already in stereotaxic space. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Automatic registration is achieved by maximization of a similarity metric, which is the correlation function of two images. The proposed method has been implemented by choosing a realistic, practical transformation and optimization techniques. Correlation-based similarity metric should be maximal when two images are perfectly aligned. Since similarity metric is a non-convex function and contains many local optima, choice of search strategy for optimization is important in registration problem. Many optimization schemes are existing, most of which are local and require a starting point. In present study we have implemented genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization technique to overcome this problem. A comparative study shows the superiority and robustness of swarm methodology over genetic approach.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Although several factors have been identified that predict outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}), no previous study has investigated the impact of hydrocephalus. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of hydrocephalus after {ICH} would predict mortality and functional outcome.
Methods—Patients with spontaneous supratentorial {ICH} were identified in our prospectively collected database to determine the following: age, sex, race, past medical history; Glasgow Coma Scale ({GCS}) score and blood pressure on admission; use of mechanical ventilation, mannitol, and ventriculostomy; and medical complications. {CT} scans performed within 24 hours of hemorrhage were retrospectively analyzed to determine lesion size and location, pineal shift, cisternal effacement, intraventricular hemorrhage ({IVH}), and hydrocephalus. Outcome was determined with use of hospital disposition (dead, nursing home, rehabilitation, home) and functional outcome (Functional Independence Measure [{FIM}]) at 3 months. Patients with and without hydrocephalus were compared and univariate and multivariate analyses performed to determine whether hydrocephalus was an independent predictor of mortality. Data are presented as mean±{SD}.
Results—Of the 81 patients studied, 40 had hydrocephalus. Those with hydrocephalus were younger (57±15 versus 67±15 years), had lower {GCS} scores (8.2±4.2 versus 11±2.9), were more likely to have ganglionic or thalamic hemorrhages, and were intubated more frequently (70\% versus 27\%). Hospital mortality was higher in patients with hydrocephalus (51\% versus 2\%), and fewer patients went home (21\% versus 35\%). Those who died had higher hydrocephalus scores (9.67±7.1 versus 5.75±4.5). Outcome was no different if a ventriculostomy was placed. The final logistic regression model included hydrocephalus score, gender, {GCS}, and pineal shift, and it correctly predicted 85\% of patients as dead or alive. Multivariate analyses indicated that hydrocephalus is an independent predictor of mortality.
Conclusions—We conclude that hydrocephalus is an independent predictor of mortality after {ICH}.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose. Controlling for intracranial volume is crucial in magnetic resonance studies of changes in brain volumes. However, full intracranial volume measurement requires prolonged scanning and analysis, and simple, validated methods for intracranial volume estimation are lacking. The authors developed and evaluated a method of estimating intracranial volume using a single mid-sagittal slice, the intracranial cross-sectional area. Methods. Forty men aged 65–70 had whole skull magnetic resonance scans at 1.9 T, with slice thickness of 1.5 mm (no interslice gap). Intracranial cross-sectional area was traced in the midline sagittal slice of the 3-view localizer. Intracranial volume was measured using every slice. Ten intracranial cross-sectional area measurements were tested for interrater reliability. Results. Intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume correlated highly (r= .88, P {\textless} .0001). A modified Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume. The intraclass correlation (an indicator of reliability) for intracranial cross-sectional area was r= .976 (P {\textless} .005). Conclusions. The rapid and simple technique of intracranial cross-sectional area measurement provides a valid and reliable estimate of intracranial volume.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose— 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ({HMG}-{CoA}) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been associated with improved outcome after ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage but an increased risk of incident intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). We investigated (1) whether statin use before {ICH} was associated with functional independence at 90 days, and (2) whether survivors exposed to statins after {ICH} had an increased risk of recurrence.
Methods— We analyzed 629 consecutive {ICH} patients with 90-day outcome data enrolled in a prospective cohort study between 1998 to 2005. Statin use was determined by patient interview at the time of {ICH} and supplemented by medical record review. Independent status was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale 4 or 5. {ICH} survivors were followed by telephone interview every 6 months.
Results— Statins were used by 149/629 (24\%) before {ICH}. There was no effect of pre-{ICH} statin use on the rates of functional independence (28\% versus 29\%, P=0.84) or mortality (46\% versus 45\%, P=0.93). Medical comorbidities and warfarin use were more common in statin users. Hematoma volumes were similar (median 28 cm3 in pre-{ICH} statin users compared to 22 cm3 in nonusers, P=0.18). The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for independent status in pre-{ICH} statin users was 1.16 (95\% {CI} 0.65 to 2.10, P=0.62). {ICH} survivors treated with statins after discharge did not have a higher risk of recurrence (adjusted {HR} 0.82, 95\% {CI} 0.34 to 1.99, P=0.66).
Conclusions— Pre-{ICH} statin use is not associated with improved {ICH} functional outcome or mortality. Post-{ICH} statin use is not associated with an increased risk of {ICH} recurrence.},

  abstract = {In a previous study (J.B. West et al., J. Comput. Assist. Tomogr., vol. 21, p. 554-66, 1997) the authors demonstrated that automatic retrospective registration algorithms can frequently register magnetic resonance ({MR}) and computed tomography ({CT}) images of the brain with an accuracy of better than 2 mm, but in that same study the authors found that such algorithms sometimes fail, leading to errors of 6 mm or more. Before these algorithms can be used routinely in the clinic, methods must be provided for distinguishing between registration solutions that are clinically satisfactory and those that are not. One approach is to rely on a human observer to inspect the registration results and reject images that have been registered with insufficient accuracy. In this paper, the authors present a methodology for evaluating the efficacy of the visual assessment of registration accuracy. Since the clinical requirements for level of registration accuracy are likely to be application dependent, the authors have evaluated the accuracy of the observer's estimate relative to 6 thresholds: 1-6 mm. The performance of the observers was evaluated relative to the registration solution obtained using external fiducial markers that are screwed into the patient's skull and that are visible in both {MR} and {CT} images. This fiducial marker system provides the gold standard for the authors' study. Its accuracy is shown to be approximately 0.5 mm. Two experienced, blinded observers viewed 5 pairs of clinical {MR} and {CT} brain images, each of which had each been misregistered with respect to the gold standard solution. Fourteen misregistrations were assessed for each image pair with misregistration errors distributed between 0 and 10 mm with approximate uniformity. For each misregistered image pair each observer estimated the registration error (in millimeters) at each of 5 locations distributed around the head using each of 3 assessment methods. These estimated errors were compared with the e- - rrors as measured by the gold standard to determine agreement relative to each of the 6 thresholds, where agreement means that the 2 errors lie on the same side of the threshold. The effect of error in the gold standard itself is taken into account in the analysis of the assessment methods. The results were analyzed by means of the Kappa statistic, the agreement rate, and the area of receiver-operating-characteristic ({ROC}) curves. No assessment performed well at 1 mm, but all methods performed well at 2 mm and higher. For these 5 thresholds, 2 methods agreed with the standard at least 80\% of the time and exhibited mean {ROC} areas greater than 0.84. One of these same methods exhibited Kappa statistics that indicated good agreement relative to chance (Kappa{\textgreater}0.6) between the pooled observers and the standard for these same 5 thresholds. Further analysis demonstrates that the results depend strongly on the choice of the distribution of misregistration errors presented to the observers.},

  abstract = {Objective: To characterize long-term mortality following intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) in two large population-based cohorts assembled more than a decade apart.
Methods: All patients age ≥18 hospitalized with nontraumatic {ICH} in the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area were identified during 1988 (Cohort 1) and from May 1998 to July 2001 and August 2002 to April 2003 (Cohort 2). Mortality was tabulated using actuarial methods and compared with a log-rank test.
Results: There were 183 patients with {ICH} in Cohort 1 and 1,041 patients in Cohort 2. Patients in Cohort 1 were more likely to be white (p = 0.024) and undergo operation for their {ICH} (p = 0.002), whereas patients in Cohort 2 were more commonly on anticoagulants (p {\textless} 0.001). Among patients in Cohort 1, mortality at 7 days, 1 year, and 10 years was 31, 59, and 82\%. Among patients in Cohort 2, mortality at 7 days and 1 year was 34 and 53\%. Mortality rates did not differ between cohorts by log-rank test (p = 0.259).
Conclusions: Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) mortality did not improve significantly between study periods. Operation for {ICH} became less frequent, whereas anticoagulant-associated {ICH} became more common.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—We conducted this study to determine, through use of multivariate analyses, the independent predictors of hematoma enlargement occurring after hospital admission in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}).
Methods—We reviewed 627 patients with {ICH} admitted within 24 hours of onset. The first {CT} was performed at admission and the second within 24 hours of admission, and a blood sample was taken for laboratory examinations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationships between hematoma enlargement and time from onset, consciousness level, {CT} findings, amount of alcohol consumption, systolic blood pressure at and after admission, clinical outcome, and hematologic parameters.
Results—Eighty-eight patients (14.0\%) showed enlarged hematomas after admission. Multivariate analyses revealed that the following five factors were independently associated with hematoma enlargement: the time from onset (odds ratio [{OR}], 0.26 for a 1-{SD} change; 4.9 hours; P{\textless}0.001); the amount of alcohol consumption ({OR}, 1.50 for 1 {SD}; 46.3 g/d; P=0.002); the sharp of hematoma ({OR}, 1.40 for 1 {SD}; 0.45 round; P=0.006); the presence of consciousness disturbance ({OR}, 1.38 for 1 {SD}; 0.50 coma; P=0.026); and the level of fibrinogen ({OR}, 0.74 for 1 {SD}; 87.1 mg/{dL}; P=0.042). Hematoma enlargement was an independent factor increasing the mortality rate in the {ICH} patients ({OR}, 1.57; P{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions—A particularly high likelihood of hematoma enlargement was observed in patients who (in order of importance) were admitted shortly after onset, who were heavy drinkers; who had an irregularly shaped hematoma, whose consciousness was disturbed, and who had a low level of fibrinogen.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) constitutes 10\% to 15\% of all strokes and remains without a treatment of proven benefit. Despite several existing outcome prediction models for {ICH}, there is no standard clinical grading scale for {ICH} analogous to those for traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke.
Methods—Records of all patients with acute {ICH} presenting to the University of California, San Francisco during 1997–1998 were reviewed. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were identified by logistic regression. A risk stratification scale (the {ICH} Score) was developed with weighting of independent predictors based on strength of association.
Results—Factors independently associated with 30-day mortality were Glasgow Coma Scale score (P{\textless}0.001), age ≥80 years (P=0.001), infratentorial origin of {ICH} (P=0.03), {ICH} volume (P=0.047), and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (P=0.052). The {ICH} Score was the sum of individual points assigned as follows: {GCS} score 3 to 4 (=2 points), 5 to 12 (=1), 13 to 15 (=0); age ≥80 years yes (=1), no (=0); infratentorial origin yes (=1), no (=0); {ICH} volume ≥30 cm3 (=1), {\textless}30 cm3 (=0); and intraventricular hemorrhage yes (=1), no (=0). All 26 patients with an {ICH} Score of 0 survived, and all 6 patients with an {ICH} Score of 5 died. Thirty-day mortality increased steadily with {ICH} Score (P{\textless}0.005).
Conclusions—The {ICH} Score is a simple clinical grading scale that allows risk stratification on presentation with {ICH}. The use of a scale such as the {ICH} Score could improve standardization of clinical treatment protocols and clinical research studies in {ICH}.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jns.2009.10.019},
  abstract = {Background
{TMS} (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and {DTT} (diffusion tensor tractography) have different advantages in evaluating stroke patients. {TMS} has good clinical accessibility and economical benefit. On the contrary, {DTT} has a unique advantage to visualize neural tracts three-dimensionally although it requires an expensive and large {MRI} machine. Many studies have demonstrated that {TMS} and {DTT} have predictive values for motor outcome in stroke patients. However, there has been no study on the comparison of these two evaluation tools. In the current study, we compared the abilities of {TMS} and {DTT} to predict upper motor outcome in patients with {ICH} (intracerebral hemorrhage).
Methods
Fifty-three consecutive patients with severe motor weakness were evaluated by {TMS} and {DTT} at the early stage (7–28 days) of {ICH}. Modified Brunnstrom classification ({MBC}) and the motricity index of upper extremity ({UMI}) were evaluated at onset and 6 months after onset.
Results
Patients with the presence of a motor evoked potential ({MEP}) in {TMS} or a preserved corticospinal tract ({CST}) in {DTT} showed better motor outcomes than those without (p = 0.000). {TMS} showed higher positive predictive value than {DTT}. In contrast, {DTT} showed higher negative predictive value than {TMS}.
Conclusions
{TMS} and {DTT} had different advantages in predicting motor outcome, and this result could be a reference to predict final neurological deficit at the early stage of {ICH}.},

The mental component is often the more important in contributing to overall social disability. Lack of an objective scale leads to vague and over-optimistic estimates of outcome, which obscure the ultimate results of early management. A five-point scale is described—death, persistent vegetative state, severe disability, moderate disability, and good recovery. Duration as well as intensity of disability should be included in an index of ill-health; this applies particularly after head injury, because many disabled survivors are young.},

  abstract = {Two new consistent image registration algorithms are presented: one is based on matching corresponding landmarks and the other is based on matching both landmark and intensity information. The consistent landmark and intensity registration algorithm produces good correspondences between images near landmark locations by matching corresponding landmarks and away from landmark locations by matching the image intensities. In contrast to similar unidirectional algorithms, these new consistent algorithms jointly estimate the forward and reverse transformation between two images while minimizing the inverse consistency error-the error between the forward (reverse) transformation and the inverse of the the reverse (forward) transformation. This reduces the ambiguous correspondence between the forward and reverse transformations associated with large inverse consistency errors. In both algorithms a thin-plate spline ({TPS}) model is used to regularize the estimated transformations. Two-dimensional (2-D) examples are presented that show the inverse consistency error produced by the traditional unidirectional landmark {TPS} algorithm can be relatively large and that this error is minimized using the consistent landmark algorithm. Results using 2-D magnetic resonance imaging data are presented that demonstrate that using landmark and intensity information together produce better correspondence between medical images than using either landmarks or intensity information alone.},

Multiple databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1990 and 2010. The {GBD} 2010 study provided standardized estimates of the incidence, mortality, mortality-to-incidence ratios ({MIR}), and disability-adjusted life years ({DALY}) lost for {HS} (including intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) by age, sex, and income level (high-income countries [{HIC}]; low- and middle-income countries [{LMIC}]) for 21 {GBD} 2010 regions in 1990, 2005, and 2010. In 2010, there were 5.3 million cases of {HS} and over 3.0 million deaths due to {HS}. There was a 47\% increase worldwide in the absolute number of {HS} cases. The largest proportion of {HS} incident cases (80\%) and deaths (63\%) occurred in {LMIC} countries. There were 62.8 million {DALY} lost (86\% in {LMIC}) due to {HS}. The overall age-standardized incidence rate of {HS} per 100,000 person-years in 2010 was 48.41 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 45.44 to 52.13) in {HIC} and 99.43 (95\% {CI}: 85.37 to 116.28) in {LMIC}, and 81.52 (95\% {CI}: 72.27 to 92.82) globally. The age-standardized incidence of {HS} increased by 18.5\% worldwide between 1990 and 2010. In {HIC}, there was a reduction in incidence of {HS} by 8\% (95\% {CI}: 1\% to 15\%), mortality by 38\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 43\%), {DALY} by 39\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 44\%), and {MIR} by 27\% (95\% {CI}: 19\% to 35\%) in the last 2 decades. In {LMIC} countries, there was a significant increase in the incidence of {HS} by 22\% (95\% {CI}: 5\% to 30\%), whereas there was a significant reduction in mortality rates of 23\% (95\% {CI}: -3\% to 36\%), {DALY} lost of 25\% (95\% {CI}: 7\% to 38\%), and {MIR} by 36\% (95\% {CI}: 16\% to 49\%). There were significant regional differences in incidence rates of {HS}, with the highest rates in {LMIC} regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, and lowest rates in High Income North America and Western Europe. The worldwide burden of {HS} has increased over the last 2 decades in terms of absolute numbers of {HS} incident events. The majority of the burden of {HS} is borne by {LMIC}. Rates for {HS} incidence, mortality, and {DALY} lost, as well as {MIR} decreased in the past 2 decades in {HIC}, but increased significantly in {LMIC} countries, particularly in those patients ≤75 years. {HS} affected people at a younger age in {LMIC} than in {HIC}. The lowest incidence and mortality rates in 2010 were in High Income North America, Australasia, and Western Europe, whereas the highest rates were in Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. These results suggest that reducing the burden of {HS} is a priority particularly in {LMIC}. The {GBD} 2010 findings may be a useful resource for planning strategies to reduce the global burden of {HS}.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose The clinical features of thalamic hemorrhage in terms of localization are of great interest in many studies. To better understand the relationship between the localization of thalamic hemorrhage and clinical features, we evaluated the characteristics of patients with four different topographic types of thalamic hemorrhage.
Methods We prospectively studied 100 patients with thalamic hemorrhage who were admitted consecutively to our primary care unit. We divided them into two groups according to large ({\textgreater}2 cm in diameter and/or {\textgreater}4 {mL} in volume) and small thalamic hemorrhage. Four topographic subgroups (large and small) were compared to identify clinical syndromes associated with distinct lesion locations.
Results All patients with posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage had severe sensorimotor deficit. Neuropsychological disturbances in patients with posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage were prominent, with primarily transcortical aphasia in those with left-sided lesions and hemineglect and anosognosia in those with right-sided lesions. Several variants of vertical gaze dysfunction, skew ocular deviation, gaze preference toward the site of the lesion, and miotic pupils were frequent in posterolateral thalamic hemorrhage, particularly in the large type. Patients with small and large anterolateral thalamic hemorrhage were characterized by severe motor and sensory deficits; language and oculomotor disturbances were also observed, although less frequently than in posterolateral hemorrhage. Sensorimotor deficits were observed in patients with medial thalamic hemorrhage (moderate in small hemorrhages and severe in large hemorrhages because of involvement of the adjacent internal capsule). Language disturbances in patients with left-sided lesions and neglect in patients with right-sided lesions were seen only in large medial thalamic hemorrhage. Dorsal thalamic hemorrhage was rare and characterized by mild and transient sensorimotor disturbances. Among patients with dorsal thalamic hemorrhages, only those with large lesions had oculomotor and neuropsychological disturbances.
Conclusions We concluded that despite clinical similarity among the four types of thalamic hemorrhage, there was some discrepancy in the clinical features of small and large thalamic hemorrhages. The most important predictors of death were initial consciousness, nuchal rigidity, maximum size, volume and ventricular extension of hemorrhage, and occurrence of hydrocephalus.},

This study specifically addressed patients seen in the emergency room within a few hours of the ictus, many of whom were still awake, to identify and subsequently exclude from surgical procedure those expected to recover completely and those expected to die regardless of treatment. We retrospectively studied 75 patients evaluated at a mean time of 3 hours and 37 minutes after hemispheric {ICH} to determine factors that would predict both good and poor outcomes at the time of discharge. Eighty percent of our patients presented within 6 hours of symptom onset. These patients were younger and had more severe lesions than did those presenting later, yet most were still awake (mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale [{GCS}] score = 11.0). Using multivariate regression, we created two models. The first model predicts independent outcome, i.e, Rankin 0 to 2, of all patients with a {GCS} score greater than 9 on admission who do not undergo surgery. The significant factors in this model were hemorrhage diameter, intraventricular extension, and age. The second model predicts poor outcome, i.e, Rankin 5 and death, of all patients. {GCS} score, hemorrhage volume, age, and gender were the important factors in this model. We conclude that {ICH} patients presenting early to the emergency room have more severe lesions radiologically, although their initial clinical status may not be different from those seen late. Our models should identify and thus exclude those with very good and very poor prognoses from future randomized surgical trials.},

  abstract = {Automatic computer processing of large multidimensional images such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) is greatly aided by deformable models, which are used to extract, identify, and quantify specific neuroanatomic structures. A general method of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features. First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior. Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human {MR} images, accurately locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological holes. This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual. The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness of cortical gray matter. Three alternative criteria for defining cortical thickness at each cortical location were developed and compared. These results are shown to corroborate published postmortem and in vivo measurements of cortical thickness.},

In this paper, we investigate the performance of various optimization methods and multiresolution strategies for maximization of mutual information, aiming at increasing registration speed when matching large high-resolution images. We show that mutual information is a continuous function of the affine registration parameters when appropriate interpolation is used and we derive analytic expressions of its derivatives that allow numerically exact evaluation of its gradient. Various multiresolution gradient- and non-gradient-based optimization strategies, such as Powell, simplex, steepest-descent, conjugate-gradient, quasi-Newton and Levenberg—Marquardt methods, are evaluated for registration of computed tomography ({CT}) and magnetic resonance images of the brain. Speed-ups of a factor of 3 on average compared to Powell's method at full resolution are achieved with similar precision and without a loss of robustness with the simplex, conjugate-gradient and Levenberg—Marquardt method using a two-level multiresolution scheme. Large data sets such as 2562 × 128 {MR} and 5122 × 48 {CT} images can be registered with subvoxel precision in {\textless} 5 min {CPU} time on current workstations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for automatic segmentation and labeling of computerised tomography ({CT}) head images of stroke lesions. The method is composed of three steps. The first step is automatic determination of head symmetry axis, with the possibility of manual improvement of the result if necessary. Symmetry axis calculation is based on moments. In the second step, the seeded region-growing ({SRG}) algorithm is used to segment the input image into a number of regions having uniform brightness. Features of these regions, such as brightness, area, neighborhood and relative position to the symmetry axis are used to create facts for a rule-based expert system. Based on created facts and pre-defined rules as input, the rule-based expert system is used in the third step to label regions as background, skull, gray/white matter, {CSF} and stroke. Experimental results have been conducted and have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method},

  abstract = {Most previously reported registration techniques that align three-dimensional image volumes by matching geometrical features such as points or surfaces use a single type of feature. The authors recently reported a hybrid registration technique that uses a weighted combination of multiple geometrical feature shapes. In this study they use the weighted geometrical feature ({WGF}) algorithm to register computed tomography ({CT}) images of the head to physical space using the skin surface only, the bone surface only, and various weighted combinations of these surfaces and one fiducial point (centroid of a bone-implanted marker). The authors use data acquired from 12 patients that underwent temporal lobe craniotomies for the resection of cerebral lesions. The authors evaluate and compare the accuracy of the registrations obtained using these various approaches by using as a reference gold standard the registration obtained using three bone-implanted markers. The results demonstrate that a combination of geometrical features can improve the accuracy of {CT}-to-physical space registration. Point-based registration requires a minimum of three noncollinear points. The position of a bone-implanted marker can be determined much more accurately than that of a skin-affixed marker or an anatomic landmark. A major disadvantage of using bone-implanted markers is that an invasive procedure is required to implant each marker. By combining surface information, the {WGF} algorithm allows registration to be performed using only one or two such markers. One important finding is that the use of a single, very accurate point (a bone-implanted marker) allows very accurate surface-based registration to be achieved using very few surface points. Finally, the {WGF} algorithm, which not only allows the combination of multiple types of geometrical information but also handles point-based and surface-based registration as degenerate cases, could form the foundation of a {"}flexible{"} surgical navigation syste- - m that allows the surgeon to use what he considers the method most appropriate for an individual clinical situation.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the vast amount of information that is rapidly accumulating about the human brain in digital form, we embarked upon a program in 1992 to develop a four–dimensional probabilistic atlas and reference system for the human brain. Through an International Consortium for Brain Mapping ({ICBM}) a dataset is being collected that includes 7000 subjects between the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono– and dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. {DNA} has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A component of the programme uses post–mortem tissue to determine the probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto– and chemoarchitectural regions in the human brain. This, combined with macroscopic information about structure and function derived from subjects in vivo, provides the first large scale opportunity to gain meaningful insights into the concordance or discordance in micro– and macroscopic structure and function. The philosophy, strategy, algorithm development, data acquisition techniques and validation methods are described in this report along with database structures. Examples of results are described for the normal adult human brain as well as examples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The ability to quantify the variance of the human brain as a function of age in a large population of subjects for whom data is also available about their genetic composition and behaviour will allow for the first assessment of cerebral genotype–phenotype–behavioural correlations in humans to take place in a population this large. This approach and its application should provide new insights and opportunities for investigators interested in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics and the evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 20\% of all stroke-related sudden neurological deficits, has the highest morbidity and mortality of all stroke, and the role of surgery remains controversial. We undertook a prospective randomised trial to compare early surgery with initial conservative treatment for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.
A parallel-group trial design was used. Early surgery combined haematoma evacuation (within 24 h of randomisation) with medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment used medical treatment, although later evacuation was allowed if necessary. We used the eight-point Glasgow outcome scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months follow-up as the primary outcome measure. We divided the patients into good and poor prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical status at randomisation. For the good prognosis group, a favourable outcome was defined as good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow outcome scale. For the poor prognosis group, a favourable outcome also included the upper level of severe disability. Analysis was by intention to treat.
1033 patients from 83 centres in 27 countries were randomised to early surgery (503) or initial conservative treatment (530). At 6 months, 51 patients were lost to follow-up, and 17 were alive with unknown status. Of 468 patients randomised to early surgery, 122 (26\%) had a favourable outcome compared with 118 (24\%) of 496 randomised to initial conservative treatment (odds ratio 0·89 [95\% {CI} 0·66–1·19], p=0·414); absolute benefit 2·3\% (–3·2 to 7·7), relative benefit 10\% (–13 to 33).
Patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage in neurosurgical units show no overall benefit from early surgery when compared with initial conservative treatment.},

We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these patients.
In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78 centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale ({GOSE}) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number {ISRCTN}22153967.
307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis, respectively. 174 (59\%) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62\%) of 286 patients in the initial conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3·7\% [95\% {CI} −4·3 to 11·6], odds ratio 0·86 [0·62 to 1·20]; p=0·367).
The {STICH} {II} results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose— The severity of the neurological deficit after ischemic stroke is moderately correlated with infarct volume. In the current study, we sought to quantify the impact of location on neurological deficit severity and to delineate this impact from that of volume.
Methods— We developed atlases consisting of location-weighted values indicating the relative importance in terms of neurological deficit severity for every voxel of the brain. These atlases were applied to 80 first-ever ischemic stroke patients to produce estimates of clinical deficit severity. Each patient had an {MRI} and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) examination just before or soon after hospital discharge. The correlation between the location-based deficit predictions and measured neurological deficit ({NIHSS}) scores were compared with the correlation obtained using volume alone to predict the neurological deficit.
Results— Volume-based estimates of neurological deficit severity were only moderately correlated with measured {NIHSS} scores (r=0.62). The combination of volume and location resulted in a significantly better correlation with clinical deficit severity (r=0.79, P=0.032).
Conclusions— The atlas methodology is a feasible way of integrating infarct size and location to predict stroke severity. It can estimate stroke severity better than volume alone.},

We hypothesized that hematoma evacuation will reduce {PHE} volume and that treatment with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-{PA}) will not exacerbate it.
Methods—Minimally invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation ({MISTIE}) phase {II} tested safety and efficacy of hematoma evacuation after {ICH}. We conducted a semiautomated, computerized volumetric analysis on computed tomography to assess impact of hematoma removal on {PHE} and effects of rt-{PA} on {PHE}. Volumetric analyses were performed on baseline stability and end of treatment scans.
Results—Seventy-nine surgical and 39 medical patients from minimally invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation phase {II} ({MISTIE} {II}) were analyzed. Mean hematoma volume at end of treatment was 19.6±14.5 cm3 for the surgical cohort and 40.7±13.9 cm3 for the medical cohort (P{\textless}0.001). Edema volume at end of treatment was lower for the surgical cohort: 27.7±13.3 cm3 than medical cohort: 41.7±14.6 cm3 (P{\textless}0.001). Graded effect of clot removal on {PHE} was observed when patients with {\textgreater}65\%, 20\% to 65\%, and {\textless}20\% {ICH} removed were analyzed (P{\textless}0.001). Positive correlation between {PHE} reduction and percent of {ICH} removed was identified (ρ=0.658; P{\textless}0.001). In the surgical cohort, 69 patients underwent surgical aspiration and rt-{PA}, whereas 10 underwent surgical aspiration only. Both cohorts achieved similar clot reduction: surgical aspiration and rt-{PA}, 18.9±14.5 cm3; and surgical aspiration only, 24.5±14.0 cm3 (P=0.26). Edema at end of treatment in surgical aspiration and rt-{PA} was 28.1±13.8 cm3 and 24.4±8.6 cm3 in surgical aspiration only (P=0.41).
Conclusions—Hematoma evacuation is associated with significant reduction in {PHE}. Furthermore, {PHE} does not seem to be exacerbated by rt-{PA}, making such neurotoxic effects unlikely when the drug is delivered to intracranial clot.},

As one of the applications of the atlas, automated brain segmentation was performed and the accuracy was measured using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping ({LDDMM}). High-quality diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) data from a single-participant were B0-distortion-corrected and transformed to the {ICBM}-152 atlas or to Talairach coordinates. The deep white matter structures, which have been previously well documented and clearly identified by {DTI}, were manually segmented. The superficial white matter areas beneath the cortex were defined, based on a population-averaged white matter probability map. The white matter was parcellated into 176 regions based on the anatomical labeling in the {ICBM}-{DTI}-81 atlas. The automated parcellation was achieved by warping this parcellation map to normal controls and to Alzheimer's disease patients with severe anatomical atrophy. The parcellation accuracy was measured by a kappa analysis between the automated and manual parcellation at 11 anatomical regions. The kappa values were 0.70 for both normal controls and patients while the inter-rater reproducibility was 0.81 (controls) and 0.82 (patients), suggesting “almost perfect” agreement. A power analysis suggested that the proposed method is suitable for detecting {FA} and size abnormalities of the white matter in clinical studies.},

We used axonal fiber alignment information from diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) to delineate the peripheral white matter, and investigated its relationship with the cortex and the deep white matter. Using {DTI} data from 81 healthy subjects, we identified nine common, blade-like anatomical regions, which were further parcellated into 21 subregions based on the cortical anatomy. Four short association fiber tracts connecting adjacent gyri (U-fibers) were also identified reproducibly among the healthy population.

A prospective randomized study of craniotomy and early hematoma removal vs best medical management was performed in 108 patients with primary {SICH}. Surgical or medical treatment was initiated within 8 hours post ictus. Principal eligibility criterium was the presence of neurologic impairment associated with a spontaneous subcortical or putaminal hemorrhage bigger than 30 {mL}. Outcomes were assessed at 1 year post ictus.
Analysis of outcome revealed a significantly higher percentage of {GOS} scores higher than 3 for the surgical patients, compared with those of the conservative group (33\% and 9\%, respectively; P {\textless} .05). By contrast, the mortality rates between operated and conservatively managed patients did not differ significantly. The main prognostic variables were the initial neurologic status, hematoma volume, and location. Stratifications of these parameters and analysis showed that the positive effect of surgery on the quality of survival was statistically not valid for patients with {GCS} scores lower than 8 or {ICH} volumes 80 {mL} or higher at the time of enrollment.
The study demonstrates that surgical patients with subcortical or putaminal hematomas showed better functional results than their conservatively treated counterparts. However, early {ICH} evacuation failed to improve the survival rates, as compared with best medical management.},

Methods based only on ‘at risk’ volumes or initial neurological condition do predict eventual outcome, but not perfectly. Given the close relationship between anatomy and function in the brain, we performed a proof-of-concept study to examine how well stroke outcome correlated with infarct location and extent. A prospective study of 60 patients with ischemic stroke (38 in the training set and 22 in the validation set), using an implementation of partial least squares with penalized logistic regression ({PLS}-{PLR}), was performed. The method yielded a model relating location of infarction (on a voxel-by-voxel basis) and neurological deficits. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ({AUC}) method was used to assess the accuracy of the method for predicting outcome. In the validation phase, this model indicated the presence of neglect ({AUC} 0.89), aphasia ({AUC} 0.79), right-arm motor deficit (0.94), and right-leg motor deficit ({AUC} 0.94) but less accurately indicated left-arm motor deficit (0.52) and left-leg motor deficit (0.69). The model indicated no to mild disability (Rankin ≤ 2) versus moderate to severe disability (Rankin \&gt; 2) with {AUC} 0.78. In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated that stroke outcome correlates well with infarct location raising the possibility of accurate prediction of neurological deficit in the individual stroke patient using only information on infarct location and multivariate regression methods.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Previous studies have shown that the volume of intracerebral hemorrhage and Glasgow Coma Score ({GCS}) on admission are powerful predictors of 30-day mortality. However, the significance of hydrocephalus associated with deep cerebral hemorrhage has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality in patients with deep cerebral hemorrhage.
Methods—We studied 100 consecutive patients with deep cerebral hemorrhage between 1994 and 1998. Deep cerebral hemorrhage was divided into 2 groups: putaminal hemorrhage (lateral group) and thalamic and caudate hemorrhage (medial group). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality.
Results—Hydrocephalus was present in 40 of the 100 patients. The 30-day mortality was 29\%, and hydrocephalus was present in 76\% of those who died. Multivariate analyses showed 2 independent prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality for putaminal hemorrhage: {GCS} ≤8 (P=0.002, odds ratio [{OR}] 37.7, {CI} 3.6 to 396.9) and hydrocephalus (P=0.005, {OR} 27.4, {CI} 2.7 to 282.6). However, only {GCS} ≤8 (P=0.0002, {OR} 16.5, {CI} 3.7 to 73.4) was predictive of 30-day mortality for thalamic and caudate hemorrhage. This model ({GCS} ≤8 and hydrocephalus) has a sensitivity of 57\% and a specificity of 91\% for predicting 30-day mortality for putaminal hemorrhage. When both attributes were present in putaminal hemorrhage ({GCS} ≤8 and hydrocephalus), 1 (11\%) of 9 patients survived, and when both attributes were missing 28 (100\%) of 28 patients survived.
Conclusions—Obstructive hydrocephalus on admission in a comatose patient with a putaminal hemorrhage predicts 30-day mortality.},

That information is then used to target the resective surgery and has great potential to affect outcome. We designed a methodological procedure intended to avoid the need for highly specialized medical resources and reduce time to identify the anatomical location of {IEs}, during the first instances of intracranial {EEG} recordings. This workflow is based on established open source software; 3D Slicer and Freesurfer that uses {MRI} and Post-implant {CT} fusion for the localization of {IEs} and its relation with automatic labeled surrounding cortex. To test this hypothesis we assessed the time elapsed between the surgical implantation process and the final anatomical localization of {IEs} by means of our proposed method compared against traditional visual analysis of raw post-implant imaging in two groups of patients. All {IEs} were identified in the first 24 H (6–24 H) of implantation using our method in 4 patients of the first group. For the control group; all {IEs} were identified by experts with an overall time range of 36 h to 3 days using traditional visual analysis. It included (7 patients), 3 patients implanted with {IEs} and the same 4 patients from the first group. Time to localization was restrained in this group by the specialized personnel and the image quality available. To validate our method; we trained two inexperienced operators to assess the position of {IEs} contacts on four patients (5 {IEs}) using the proposed method. We quantified the discrepancies between operators and we also assessed the efficiency of our method to define the {EZ} comparing the findings against the results of traditional analysis.},

Although the number of hospital admissions for intracerebral haemorrhage has increased worldwide in the past 10 years, mortality has not fallen.

Development of treatment goals for critical care, and new sequences of care and specialty practice can improve outcome after intracerebral haemorrhage. Specific treatment approaches include early diagnosis and haemostasis, aggressive management of blood pressure, open surgical and minimally invasive surgical techniques to remove clot, techniques to remove intraventricular blood, and management of intracranial pressure. These approaches improve clinical management of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and promise to reduce mortality and increase functional survival.},

Methods Clinical and demographic data were extracted from the charts of 182 consecutive black Americans admitted for {SICH} diagnosed by clinical criteria and initial {CT} scan.

Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of early deterioration (defined as a decrease from an initial Glasgow Coma Scale score {\textgreater}12 by ≥4 points within 24 hours from presentation) and mortality.
Results Both hemorrhage volume and ventricular extension were significant, independent predictors of early deterioration (odds ratio [{OR}], 6.78; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.89 to 24.35 and {OR}, 4.67; 95\% {CI}, 1.30 to 16.72, respectively) and mortality ({OR}, 6.66; 95\% {CI}, 2.85 to 15.58 and {OR}, 4.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.82 to 9.82, respectively).

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND} The present study was undertaken to evaluate the determinants of acute (30-day) mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) in a developing country setting, and to compare these findings with those available from studies conducted in the West.
{METHODS} Medical records of 146 patients admitted to a major tertiary hospital in Karachi, Pakistan between 1990 and 1991 with a diagnosis of spontaneous {ICH} were reviewed. The level and intensity of care provided to these patients was similar to that available at modern neurosurgical centers. The salient prognostic indicators that were studied included hypertension, pulse pressure, {GCS} score, neurologic deficits, and {CT}-scan predictors including site, size, and intraventricular spread of hemorrhage. These data were used to determine independent predictors of 30-day mortality by univariate and multivariate analysis. Additionally, 30-day survival probabilities for these outcome predictors were also computed.
{RESULTS} The 30-day mortality after spontaneous {ICH} was 39.7\%. Two-thirds of the patients had a history of hypertension. The important clinical predictors at the multivariate level included {GCS} score ≤8 and progressive increase in pulse pressure. The {CT} scan predictors included intraventricular spread of hemorrhage, ventricular enlargement, and size of the bleed. Location of the lesion did not appear to significantly influence mortality. Survival analysis showed a large clustering of deaths within the first 72 hours of hospitalization.
{CONCLUSIONS} The 30-day mortality rate and prognostic predictors for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage were found to be similar to those reported in the Western hemisphere. However, the correlation of incremental increase in pulse pressure with deteriorating prognosis was a new and significant finding.},

  abstract = {Accurate identification of brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) in a whole-head {MRI} is a critical first step in many neuroimaging studies. Automating this procedure can eliminate intra- and interrater variance and greatly increase throughput for a labor-intensive step. Many available procedures perform differently across anatomy and under different acquisition protocols. We developed the Brain Extraction Meta-Algorithm ({BEMA}) to address these concerns. It executes many extraction algorithms and a registration procedure in parallel to combine the results in an intelligent fashion and obtain improved results over any of the individual algorithms. Using an atlas space, {BEMA} performs a voxelwise analysis of training data to determine the optimal Boolean combination of extraction algorithms to produce the most accurate result for a given voxel. This allows the provided extractors to be used differentially across anatomy, increasing both the accuracy and robustness of the procedure.

Each of these methods has drawbacks for the display of neuroanatomical data. One solution is to display {MRI} scans in the same stereotaxic space popular with researchers working in functional neuroimaging. Presenting brains in this format is useful as the slices correspond to the standard anatomical atlases used by neuroimagers. In addition, lesion position and volume are directly comparable across patients. This article describes freely available software for presenting stereotaxically aligned patient scans. This article focuses on {MRI} scans, but many of these tools are also applicable to other modalities (e.g. {CT}, {PET} and {SPECT}). We suggest that this technique of presenting lesions in terms of images normalized to standard stereotaxic space should become the standard for neuropsychological studies.},

The most popular standard templates are derived from {MRI} scans of young adults. We introduce specialized templates that allow normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged populations. First, we developed a {CT} template: while this is the dominant modality for many clinical situations, there are no modern {CT} templates and popular algorithms fail to successfully normalize {CT} scans. Importantly, our template was based on healthy individuals with ages similar to what is commonly seen in stroke (mean 65 years old). This template allows studies where only {CT} scans are available. Second, we derived a {MRI} template that approximately matches the shape of our {CT} template as well as processing steps that aid the normalization of scans from older individuals (including lesion masking and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings despite brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present. We have integrated these templates and processing algorithms into a simple {SPM} toolbox (http://www.mricro.com/clinical-toolbox/spm8-scripts).},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Reduction in infarct volume is the standard measure of therapeutic success in animal stroke models. Reduction in infarct volume has been advocated as a biological surrogate or auxiliary outcome measure for human stroke clinical trials to replace or supplement deficit, disability, and global clinical scales. However, few studies have investigated correlations between infarct volume and clinical end points in acute ischemic stroke patients.
Methods—{CT} scans at days 6 to 11 were acquired prospectively in 191 fully eligible patients enrolled in the Randomized Trial of Tirilazad Mesylate in Patients With Acute Stroke ({RANTTAS}). Patients were enrolled within 6 hours of onset of stroke in any vessel distribution. Infarct volume was measured by operator-assisted computerized planimetry.
Results—One hundred thirty-two patients had visible new supratentorial infarcts, with median infarct volume of 28.0 cm3 (interquartile range, 9.0 to 93.0 cm3). Fifty-nine patients had no visible new infarct. Correlations with standard 3-month outcome scales and mortality were as follows: Barthel Index, r=0.43; Glasgow Outcome Scale, r=0.53; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, r=0.54; mortality, r=0.31. For visible infarcts alone, correlations were as follows: {BI}, r=0.46; {GOS}, r=0.59; {NIHSS}, r=0.56; mortality, r=0.32.
Conclusions—Subacute {CT} infarct volume correlates moderately with 3-month clinical outcome as assessed by widely used neurological and functional assessment scales. The modesty of this linkage constrains the use of infarct volume as a surrogate end point in ischemic stroke clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Greater loss in structural integrity of the ipsilesional corticospinal tract ({CST}) is associated with poorer motor outcome in patients with hemiparetic stroke. Animal models of stroke have demonstrated that structural remodeling of white matter in the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres is associated with improved motor recovery. Accordingly, motor recovery in patients with stroke may relate to the relative strength of {CST} degeneration and remodeling. This study examined the relationship between microstructural status of brain white matter tracts, indexed by the fractional anisotropy ({FA}) metric derived from diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) data, and motor skill of the stroke-affected hand in patients with chronic stroke. Voxelwise analysis revealed that motor skill significantly and positively correlated with {FA} of the ipsilesional and contralesional {CST} in the patients. Additional voxelwise analyses showed that patients with poorer motor skill had reduced {FA} of bilateral {CST} compared to normal control subjects, whereas patients with better motor skill had elevated {FA} of bilateral {CST} compared to controls. These findings were confirmed using a {DTI}-tractography method applied to the {CST} in both hemispheres. The results of this study suggest that the level of motor skill recovery achieved in patients with hemiparetic stroke relates to microstructural status of the {CST} in both the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres, which may reflect the net effect of degeneration and remodeling of bilateral {CST}.

  abstract = {Background and Purpose— Our purpose was to determine (1) the correlation between quantitative {CT} and {MR} measurements of infarct core, penumbra, and mismatch; and (2) whether the difference between these measurements would alter patient selection for stroke clinical trials.
Methods— We studied 45 patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke imaged a mean of 3.8 hours after onset (range, 0.48 to 8.35 hours) who underwent {CT} perfusion and {MR} diffusion ({DWI})/perfusion imaging within 3 hours of each other. The {DWI} and {MR}-mean transit time ({MTT}) abnormalities were visually segmented using a semiautomated commercial analysis program. The {CT}-cerebral blood volume) and {CT}-{MTT} lesions were automatically segmented using a relative cerebral blood volume threshold of 0.56 and a relative {MTT} threshold of 1.50 on commercially available software. Percent mismatch was defined as [({MTT}−{DWI})/{DWI} volume]×100. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated.
Results— There were significant correlations for {DWI} versus {CT}-cerebral blood volume lesion volumes (r2=0.88, P{\textless}0.001), for {MR}-{MTT} versus {CT}-{MTT} lesion volumes(r2=0.86, P{\textless}0.001), and for {MR}-{MTT}/{DWI} versus {CT}-{MTT}/{CT}-cerebral blood volume mismatch lesion volumes(r2=0.81, P{\textless}0.001). {MR} perfusion and {CT} perfusion agreed for determining: (1) infarct core {\textless} versus ≥100 {mL} in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); (2) {MTT} lesion size {\textless} versus {\textgreater}2 cm diameter in 42 of 45 (93.3\%); (3) mismatch {\textless} versus {\textgreater}20\% in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); and (4) inclusion versus exclusion from trial enrollment in 38 of 45 (84.4\%) patients. Six of 7 disagreements were due to inadequate {CT} coverage.
Conclusion— Advanced {MR} and {CT} perfusion imaging measurements of core/penumbra mismatch for patient selection in stroke trials are highly correlated when {CT} perfusion coverage is sufficient to include most of the ischemic region. Although {MR} is currently the preferred imaging method for determining core and penumbra, {CT} perfusion is comparable and potentially more available.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose— Hemorrhagic transformation ({HT}) is a potentially dangerous complication of thrombolytic therapy. Recent studies suggest that diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({DWI}) can help to predict the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) after thrombolysis. We sought to examine which pretreatment {DWI} parameters and clinical data are predictive of {ICH} after intravenous thrombolysis.
Methods— We retrospectively reviewed our prospective stroke database for patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ({rtPA}) within 3 hours from symptom onset who had {DWI} before treatment and {MRI} with T2* sequence or {CT} 24 to 48 hours later to assess for {ICH} over the past 4 years. We measured the volumes and voxel-by-voxel apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC}) values of the initial {DWI} lesions and retrieved demographic data, risk factors, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) scores on admission, and blood tests results. We examined several variables using univariate and multivariate regression analyses to determine predictors of {ICH}.
Results— Twenty-nine patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria; 17 patients (58\%) had {ICH}, and of these 4 (13\%) had symptomatic {ICH} and fatal outcome. On univariate analysis, higher systolic blood pressure, {NIHSS} score, serum glucose level, volume of initial {DWI} lesion, and absolute number of voxels with {ADC} value ≤550×10−6 mm2/s were statistically associated with {ICH}, and all were subjected to multivariate analysis. However, only the absolute number of voxels, ie, volume of ischemic tissue on {DWI}, with {ADC} ≤550×10−6 mm2/s emerged as an independent predictor of {ICH}.
Conclusions— Our findings suggest that volumetric {ADC} analysis can be used to assess {ICH} risk after thrombolysis. This may be particularly helpful if {rtPA} is to be given outside the 3-hour window.},

The validity of the proposed model was controlled on a test-sample of 66 patients from another department.

  abstract = {Background: Mid-life stroke risk factors have been related to late-life cognitive impairment. This association may result not only from clinical strokes but also from subclinical brain injury, such as a global atrophy demonstrable on quantitative brain {MRI}.
Methods: The authors evaluated the community-based cohort of Framingham Offspring Study participants. A total of 1,841 subjects (mean age, 62 years; 857 men, 984 women) who underwent quantitative {MRI} and cognitive testing between 1999 and 2001 and were free of clinical stroke and dementia constituted our study sample. The authors used age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models to relate previous (1991 to 1995) and recent (1998 to 2001) Framingham Stroke Risk Profile ({FSRP}) scores to the total cerebral brain volume ratio ({TCBVr}) on follow-up {MRI}, and further to relate the {TCBVr} with education-adjusted scores on neuropsychological tests administered at the time of imaging.
Results: There was an inverse association between {FSRP} scores and {TCBVr}. The {TCBVr} also showed a significant positive association with performance on tests of attention (Trails A), executive function (Trails B), and visuospatial function (visual reproduction, Hooper visual organization), but not with performance on tests of verbal memory or naming.
Conclusions: The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile may identify subjects with smaller brains and poorer cognitive function among stroke- and dementia-free subjects, reinforcing the importance of managing stroke risk factors.},

Since our previous publication, there have been significant improvements to this software package which utilize methods standard to the neuroimaging community. These features include spatial normalization to the {MNI} template brain (standard of the international consortium for brain mapping), and use of the volume occupancy Talairach labels ({VOTL}) and automated anatomical labeling ({AAL}) atlases for full brain quantification of structures impacted by the lesion. Methods for multi-subject studies including lesion-symptom mapping proposed by Bates et al. have been extended in {ABLe} to produce an exploratory analysis summarizing correlations between subjects with overlapping lesions and behavioral deficit. A subset of data from an ongoing traumatic head injury study correlating deficit with brain anatomy is used to demonstrate the power of this software package.},

  abstract = {Objective: The maturation of the neocortex during childhood and adolescence involves dramatic increases in white-matter volume. {EEG} recordings from children and adults were examined to determine whether there are associated changes in spatial properties of dynamic processes in the neocortex.
Methods: Spontaneous eyes-closed and eyes-open {EEG} were recorded at 128 electrodes in 20 children aged 6–11 years and 23 adults aged 18–23 years. The surface Laplacian algorithm was applied to improve the spatial resolution of each electrode. Power and coherence were used to characterize the spatial structure of the alpha rhythm. A stochastic field model was used to eliminate coherences that are inflated due to volume conduction.
Results: In adults, the alpha rhythm is characterized by very high coherence between distant electrodes. The children demonstrated reduced anterior power and coherence between anterior and posterior electrodes at the peak alpha frequency in comparison to the adults. The Laplacian alpha rhythm demonstrated much higher power in the children at both anterior and posterior electrodes, but was weakly correlated between electrodes.
Conclusions: The maturation of neocortex in late childhood involves increased global correlation by long-range corticocortical connections. The local correlation that contributes power to each electrode, independent of other electrodes, is reduced as the global correlation increases.},

We compare four proposed measures of voxel similarity using the same optimization scheme when presented with 10 pairs of images with a range of initial misregistrations. The registration estimates are compared with those provided by manual point-based registration and evaluated by visual inspection to give an assessment of the robustness and accuracy of the different measures. One full-volume {CT} image set is used to investigate the performance of each measure when used to align truncated images from different regions in the head. The soft tissue correlation and mutual information measures were found to provide the most robust measures of misregistration, providing results comparable to or better than those from manual point-based registration for all but the most truncated image volumes.},

  abstract = {Background The purpose of this study was to define the incidence, imaging characteristics, natural history, and prognostic implication of corticospinal tract Wallerian degeneration ({CST}‐{WD}) in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) using serial {MR} imaging.
Methods and Results Consecutive {ICH} patients with supratentorial {ICH} prospectively underwent serial {MRIs} at 2, 7, 14, and 21 days. {MRIs} were analyzed by independent raters for the presence and topographical distribution of {CST}‐{WD} on diffusion‐weighted imaging ({DWI}). Baseline demographics, hematoma characteristics, {ICH} score, and admission National Institute of Health Stroke Score ({NIHSS}) were systematically recorded. Functional outcome at 3 months was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale ({mRS}) and the motor‐{NIHSS}. Twenty‐seven patients underwent 93 {MRIs}; 88 of these were serially obtained in the first month. In 13 patients (48\%), all with deep {ICH}, {CST}‐{WD} changes were observed after a median of 7 days (interquartile range, 7 to 8) as reduced diffusion on {DWI} and progressed rostrocaudally along the {CST}. {CST}‐{WD} changes evolved into T2‐hyperintense areas after a median of 11 days (interquartile range, 6 to 14) and became atrophic on {MRIs} obtained after 3 months. In univariate analyses, the presence of {CST}‐{WD} was associated with poor functional outcome (ie, {mRS} 4 to 6; P=0.046) and worse motor‐{NIHSS} (5 versus 1, P=0.001) at 3 months.
Conclusions Wallerian degeneration along the {CST} is common in spontaneous supratentorial {ICH}, particularly in deep {ICH}. It can be detected 1 week after {ICH} on {DWI} and progresses rostrocaudally along the {CST} over time. The presence of {CST}‐{WD} is associated with poor motor and functional recovery after {ICH}.},

  abstract = {1. Researchers frequently take repeated measurements of individuals in a sample with the goal of quantifying the proportion of the total variation that can be attributed to variation among individuals vs. variation among measurements within individuals. The proportion of the variation attributed to variation among individuals is known as repeatability and is most frequently estimated as the intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}). The goal of our study is to provide guidelines for determining the sample size (number of individuals and number of measurements per individual) required to accurately estimate the {ICC}. 2. We report a range of {ICCs} from the literature and estimate 95\% confidence intervals for these estimates. We introduce a predictive equation derived by Bonett (2002), and we test the assumptions of this equation through simulation. Finally, we create an R statistical package for the planning of experiments and estimation of {ICCs}. 3. Repeatability estimates were reported in 1·5\% of the articles published in the journals surveyed. Repeatabilities tended to be highest when the {ICC} was used to estimate measurement error and lowest when it was used to estimate repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Few authors report confidence intervals, but our estimated 95\% confidence intervals for published {ICCs} generally indicated a low level of precision associated with these estimates. This survey demonstrates the need for a protocol to estimate repeatability. 4. Analysis of the predictions from Bonett’s equation over a range of sample sizes, expected repeatabilities and desired confidence interval widths yields both analytical and intuitive guidelines for designing experiments to estimate repeatability. However, we find a tendency for the confidence interval to be underestimated by the equation when {ICCs} are high and overestimated when {ICCs} and the number of measurements per individual are low. 5. The sample size to use when estimating repeatability is a question pitting investigator effort against expected precision of the estimate. We offer guidelines that apply over a wide variety of ecological and evolutionary studies estimating repeatability, measurement error or heritability. Additionally, we provide the R package, icc, to facilitate analyses and determine the most economic use of resources when planning experiments to estimate repeatability.},

  abstract = {Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tract ({CST}) after motor pathway ischemic stroke can be characterized by diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}). However, the dynamic evolution of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} has not previously been completely identified. We investigated this dynamic evolution and the relationship between early changes of the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} and long-term clinical outcomes. {DTI} and neurological examinations were performed repeatedly in 9 patients with first-onset motor pathway subcortical infarction at 5 consecutive time points, i.e. within 1 week, at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year. Using a region of interest method, we analyzed the ratios of the fractional anisotropy ({rFA}), mean diffusivity ({rMD}), primary eigenvalue (rλ1) and transverse eigenvalue (rλ23) between the affected and unaffected sides of the {CSTs}. We did not find any significant changes in the diffusion indices of the contralesional {CSTs} across time points. The {rFA} decreased monotonously during the first 3 months and then stabilized. The {rMD} increased after 2 weeks and stabilized after the third month. The rλ1 decreased during the first 2 weeks and then remained unchanged. The rλ23 increased during the first 3 months and then stabilized. We also found that the changes in the {rFA} between the first 2 time points were correlated with the {NIHSS} (P = 0.00003) and the Motricity Indices (P = 0.0004) after 1 year. Our results suggest that for patients with motor pathway stroke the diffusion indices in the degenerated {CST} stabilize within 3 months and that early changes in the {rFA} of the {CST} may predict long-term clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background

In adults, intraventricular thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ({rtPA}) facilitates resolution of intraventricular haemorrhage ({IVH}), reduces intracranial pressure, decreases duration of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, and may ameliorate direct neural injury. We hypothesize that patients with small parenchymal haematoma volumes ({\textless}30 cc) and relatively large {IVH} causing acute obstructive hydrocephalus would have improved clinical outcomes when given injections of low-dose {rtPA} to accelerate lysis and evacuation of {IVH} compared with placebo.


Methods

The Clot Lysis Evaluation of Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage {III} trial is an investigator-initiated, phase {III}, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the use of external ventricular drainage ({EVD}) combined with intraventricular injection of {rtPA} to {EVD} plus intraventricular injection of normal saline (placebo) for the treatment of {IVH}. Patients with known symptom onset within 24 h of the computed tomography scan confirmed {IVH} and third or fourth ventricle obstruction, with or without supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage volume {\textless}30 cc, who require {EVD} are screened with a computed tomography scan at least six hours after {EVD} placement and, if necessary, at consecutive 12-h intervals until stabilization of any intracranial bleeding has been established. Patients who meet clinical and imaging criteria (no ongoing coagulopathy and no suspicion of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or any other vascular anomaly) will be randomized to either intraventricular {rtPA} or placebo.


Results

The primary outcome measure is dichotomized modified Rankin Scale 0–3 vs. 4–6 at 180 days. Clinical secondary outcomes include additional modified Rankin Scale dichotomizations at 180 days (0–4 vs. 5–6), ordinal modified Rankin Scale (0–6), mortality and safety events at 30 days, mortality at 180 days, functional status measures, type and intensity of intensive care unit management, rate and extent of ventricular blood clot removal, and quality of life measures.},
